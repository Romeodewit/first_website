            <h2>Describing the content and layout for each page.</h2>
            <p>
                The way I’ve currently laid out the website is as followed:<br>
                It starts off with the main welcome page. If you click welcome to my page it will just send you back to the welcome page again. Up top is the navigation bar. I’ve added small animations to the buttons on the top so that when you hover over them a small black line appears. The navigation bar has a button for Home, About me, Unit 1, Unit 2, and References. Each button will take you to its respective page. The navigation bar is the same on all pages. About me is a little Bio about my previous work, and previous roles within different companies. Unit 1 has all the answers to the questions of Unit 1. Unit 2 Has all the answers to the questions on Unit 2. The reference page has all the references numbered with the links underneath them. 1 thing I did add it within the pages when clicking on a reference number it will take you straight to the referred website rather than the reference page to make it a bit easier to navigate. The bottom of the page has a footer with my contact details, and a link to a Terms and conditions/privacy policy and pictures of my dog.

        <h2>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
        <p>
        Copyright is essentially the right to use or claim a piece of work you’ve created, going from a piece of code you’ve put together, to a website you’ve created, to a piece of music you might have come up with. If you copyright your work it essentially means that work is yours and others are not allowed to use it without your permission. Copyright is an important part for not only yourself but also the rest of the community. It is also important that when you use someone else’s code you ensure to check if the code is licensed and you need to ask permission to use the code. Same thing goes when you create a code, always make sure it’s licensed. This way if someone uses your work for criminal activity without the permission to use your code, you are at least protected. If you want to find which license is the right license for you the best way to check this is by using <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">Choose a License</a> which can help you find the right license. 1 think to take away; every single country has their own set of rules for what licensing is and entitles. If you want to create an open source code, always make sure you get it licensed in 1 way or another which in case of open source can be done with an “Unlicense” which details exactly what your “open source” means.<a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/3/what-open-source-programming">[8]</a>

        <h2>Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
        <p>
        When designing a website there are a number of things that need to be taken into account to ensure the website is accessible for all. As Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of the WWW once said; “The power of the web is in it’s universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect”. Websites should be accessible for everyone and in some ways should make it easier for people with a disability to communicate, but a poorly designed website can create barriers for people with a disability when using the web.
        
        A website needs to be accessible for people with a disability. To do this it needs to be able to be perceived, understood, and navigated with ease, and when applicable people with a disability should be able to contribute to it only (e.g. public forums).
        Web accessibility can be affected by a number of things; auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual, with the last 3 being most important. 
        
        There is a number of ways to ensure everyone to use your website, people who are blind are suffer from restrictive eyesight will benefit massively from a text to speech function, whereas older people might benefit from larger font sizes. Ensuring navigation is visible and easy to access is another point that needs to be taken into account. 
        
        Lastly remember website accessibility is a requirement by law in a lot of situations, especially for large businesses, so always make sure you read the proper guidelines of accessibility when developing a website.<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">[9]</a>

        <h2>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
        <p>
        When choosing the appropriate filetypes for your website make sure you choose the right ones (at the right file size).  The most commonly used filetypes used on website are JPG for small images, PNG which is another image type, GIFs which are moving image types, TIF which is generally used for high quality image types, and SVG files which are high quality image files largely used for logos and other graphicly designed content. Choosing the right filetype depends and what you want the file to be. If you’re only using small pictures where pixels are not really visible you can use JPG, which because of its small compressed file format is great when you are putting a lot of content on 1 page. When using a background however its best to use TIF images since these type files don’t loose out on quality when used meaning you’ll get a crisp and clear image. GIFs can add a little bit of visuals to your website and make it more interactive, while PNG images are largely used as regular quality images where you don’t want the lesser image quality of JPG images. For small videos .WEBM files are used because of its open video format which is easily embedded on websites in the context of HTML5 video, while .FLV is more used for streaming videos over the web using Adobe Flash player. There are 100’s of different files to choose from and for a more in depth list please visit this <a href="https://websitebuilders.com/how-to/learn-to-download/extensions/">link</a> for more information.<a href="https://websitebuilders.com/how-to/learn-to-download/extensions/">[10]</a> <a href="https://www.fatrabbitcreative.com/blog/what-image-format-should-i-use-on-my-website">[11]</a>
