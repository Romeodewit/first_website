            <h2>Describing the purpose of IT in modern Business:</h2>
            <p>
            The way IT is completely revolutionizing not only modern businesses but also professions that have been around for 1000’s of years is comparable to introduction of steam power during the industrial revolution. 
            A big part of it comes from the ability to completely automize tasks that would normally take hours, if not days to perform and require a lot of extra staff to be completed accurately.<br><br> 
            Take the IT department in a warehouse for example. Previously warehouses would have to keep a record of stock going in and out of the warehouse by hand, resulting into enormous amounts of manual written paperwork which would take copious amounts of time to search through.
            These days however we are fully able to automize this with the use of stock programs and excel sheets making it easy to access records at any time of day. <br>
            We can also use IT to perform our day to day mathematics, securely store transaction and bank records, quickly communicate with everyone within a large corporation, keep track of costumer records and purchasing and many more. 
            IT has completely changed the way we work leaving a lot of room for innovation and growth, reducing staff costs and making both consumer and corporate experiences a lot more efficient. <a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380">[1]</a>

            <h2>Describing methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful? what tools? What Skills?</h2>
            <p>
            In order to successfully complete a digital project you would need a multitude of skills which would normally be considered project management skills A couple of big skills that are an absolute necessity are strong communication skills, problem solve skills, attention to detail, strong organization skills, being able to collaborate, being able to simplify complex workflows (ensuring workflow is streamlined and ordered) being tech-savvy (you don’t necessarily need to know every piece of code in front and back end development, but a little bit of basic knowledge goes a long way), and last but not least being Goal driven.<br><br> There are a number of methods that can be applied to ensure success. One handy skill I’ve previously used working on project is setting S.M.A.R.T. goals to ensure goals are both achievable and realistic while ensuring they are time bound. Another method is  the Kanban method to ensure workload is visualised making organisation easier  In terms of tools using programmes like Trello to visualise your Kanban board, and using slack for communication are incredibly important and can massively decrees workload ensuring success.<a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog/digital-project-manager/">[2]</a> <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-a-technology-stack-choosing-the-right-tech-stack-for-your-web-project-3f295cf60f10">[3]</a>

            <h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
            <p>
            The easiest way to plan out making a website is with the Kanban method. First off researching the easiest way and necessary steps to create a website is the best way to start. Next up it’s best to visualise these steps using the Kanban method. I’ve used Trello to make this process as simple as possible. You can find out more about the steps I’m using when creating my website on my <a href="https://trello.com/b/UXHPVLpn/website-development">Trello board</a>.

            <h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
            <p>
            Looking at statistics it is recorded that somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail. This looks like a lot but when we actually look at the scope that this is measured in going from, the project being a complete failure to the project having some issues at the launch that might be fixed later on turning the project into a success we can safely assume that the actual failure number is a bit lower. There is a lot of different reasons a project might fail. Looking at companies like apple, Microsoft, and Nike, who although having billions to spend on these projects still have a lot of failed digital projects every year. This has largely to do with a difference in understanding. Where a lot of large companies might be doing extremely well without full e-commerce (think Primark who still don’t have an online store) some are in desperate need of digital innovation, however without having the right scope, and hiring a digital team being completely new to some of these companies can lead to some problems in terms of bot expectations and accounting for business processes. Where a digital team might be setting up their 1000th online store, the company might not be streamlined enough to have the ability to fulfill orders on time due to logistic issues leading to a failed digital project. 
            Other reasons might be a lot less company related a lot more project planning created. Using a certain version of a development software only to 6 months later hear the development software has a new update that doesn’t support your old project can be a massive setback for a lot of digital projects (especially on IOS). A key member might be leaving the project for a different project which also leads to set backs.
            The best way to ensure you don’t run into these problems is with proper planning, ensuring the work scope is visualized and both developers and the company are fully aware of expectations and achievability (again S.M.A.R.T.  goals are an extremely good tool to use in these occasions).<a href="https://www.enginess.io/insights/why-digital-projects-fail">[4]</a>

            <h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
            <p>
            The best way to start figuring out what tech to use when it comes to your IT systems and software is by looking at scope, design, functionality, and end goal. First of all what is it you want to achieve? Is it developing a website? An app? Backend stock software for a warehouse? A booking system for a restaurant? All of these require a completely different set of software which you could call a tech stack (a stack of overlapping development software that gives you a combined end result). When you’ve figured out the concept and scope of the project it’s time to put this tech stack together and ensure you’re using the right software for the right job. This can be divided in front-end(the visuals of your project) which are programs like HTML/HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and UI frameworks and libraries, and back-end(the more data heavy part of the project) which is software like SQL, Python, programming languages, databases, and even cloud infrastructures. You can then base your decision on your own knowledge of coding, how easy it is to maintain the product after its finished with the software used, the actual security of the software, and the scalability since some software is better for certain aspects of this than others. In case of this project I’ll be using HTML and CSS for the front-end website, while using Trello and Slack for communication and Planning. <a href="https://www.middlestone.ltd/blog/steps-to-choosing-software-that-is-right-for-your-small-business">[5]</a>

            <h2>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h2>
            <p>
            The chosen technology I’m currently using is Trello, which for me has been a massive help when it comes to planning out my day to day. Not only does it give me the ability to keep an eye on my current workload, but also gives me the ability to go onto another assignment when I get stuck on an assignment and then get back to it later. It keeps me organized and gives me the ability to plan ahead and visualize my work scope using the Kanban method.
            Looking at the information on Git it’s essentially a version control system allowing me to go back to a previous version of my code. During coding you can make a lot of mistakes which are sometimes not directly pinpointed. Lets say a header has been at the right place from the start but after a couple more additions to the code the header all of a sudden gets displaced. With the use of Git you can pinpoint exactly where you went wrong by going back a couple of versions and seeing what part of the added code messed it up. You can then change this and move on. 
            Git hub on the other hand is a cloud based platform where you can share your git (your versions of your code) for others to see which can be a massive help when getting stuck on certain bits of code. It should also provide me with a friendlier user interface for git and a handy task management system to ensure I stay on track. <a href="https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/">[6]</a>

            <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
            <p>
            “Europe’s new data privacy and security law includes hundreds of pages’ worth of new requirements for organizations around the world. This GDPR overview will help you understand the law and determine what parts of it apply to you.
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will levy harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros.” <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">Source</a>".
            <br>
            <br>
            GDPR was set up as away of ensuring peoples private and personal data is stored in the correct manner to avoid fraud, unlawful handling of data and consumer protection. This goes for personal data, data processing, data subject, data controller (who’s accessing the data),and the data processor(maybe data processing is outsourced and if so, who’s responsible for this and are they following the right guidelines.
            The legal guidelines are below:<br><br>
        •	Lawfulness, fairness and transparency — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.<br>
        •	Purpose limitation — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.<br>
        •	Data minimization — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.<br>
        •	Accuracy — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.<br>
        •	Storage limitation — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.<br>
        •	Integrity and confidentiality — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).<br>
        •	Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.<br><br>
            These points can be a lot more in depth and penalties for improper handling of data can lead to hefty fines of up to 20 million euros of even 4% of global revenue (whichever is higher). It’s therefore extremely important you follow these guidelines according when developing an IT project especially when consumer input is involved.<a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">[7]</a><br>
