            <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h2>
            <p>
                Looking at the tools I used for building my website and the tools that are available I’m very happy with the tools used. Trello has helped me keep on top of my work massively, while VS Code has been amazing, especially with the different types of plugins you can use to make coding a lot easier. Both tools helped me get the project done on time, and the autofill function on VS Code really speeds things up when coding your website.

            <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h2>
            <p>
            VS code was definitely the appropriate tool to use for this project. Its functionality is amazing, being able to split your screen in half and use CSS on 1 side while using HTML on the other makes it very easy to get everything coded up, and it makes small adjustments easy and quick. Trello is great for staying on top of your tasks but, because of the size of this project, feels a bit unnecessary if and when you’re working on your own. However, because this was my first website project it definitely helped me assess my workload a lot better.

            <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
            <p>
                Looking at the final project I can say I’m very happy with the outlook. Seen as this is my first website with absolutely no prior knowledge of coding whatsoever, I’m quite happy with its functionality and small animations added through VS code. It was definitely challenging getting the navigation bar to work properly but I got there in the end. Would definitely want to change the entire design, since it looks very cheap atm and the font is not very readable. With more time I would have put a lot more work into the design, and learn more about spacing to ensure the website reads and looks better.

            <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
            <p>
                When looking at the project I would love to improve the actual design. I’m not a fan of how the text appears on the page atm on would have loved to design this in a way it looks and feels a lot more professional. Would also like to add some more functionality like text appearing on screen, maybe a slight bit more animation styles, and just polish everything up a bit.

            <p>
                Looking at the outcome of the final website I feel like it does what it says on the tin. It displays the information that needs to be displayed which in this case is the answers to the questions, the navigation bar works perfectly and even has a little animation. The links all work and display the websites that I got my references from, and the website is currently bug-free.
