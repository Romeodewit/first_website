            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
            Having spent a total of 9 years in Hospitality, working for some of the largest brands in the drinks industry, creating and curating education programs, developing both alcoholic and non-alcoholic products, and consulting on large bar and restaurant projects, I have built up a large network of hospitality professionals.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Originally born in the Netherlands I’ve always had a passion for hospitality, starting at a very young age. Working my way up through the ranks and getting my first management gig at age 20 creating and curating an award-winning drinks list in 2014 in Amsterdam, I decided to move to London in 2016. It’s here my Hospitality career really kicked off, managing one of the new bar projects for Tristan Stephenson and Tomas Aske, setting up London’s first draft cocktail bar, managing the Blind Pig (top 10 best restaurant bars Tales of the Cocktail 2018), and working on a small bar and restaurant consultancy across London. <br>
            <br>
            In 2018 I joined the team at the Crucible, which was London’s first drinks orientated co-working space and creative/consultancy agency. At Crucible my time was largely spent working on education, training, and product development, both creating and curating education material for large beverage companies like Diageo and Pernod Ricard, and developing both alcoholic and non-alcoholic products for large clients. <br>
            <br>
            In 2020 I started a hospitality consultancy company called Classic Remedies, which focuses on consultancy within the Hospitality industry ranging from staff training, spirit education, product development, and bar & restaurant consultancy. This is partially what I based my website on, and the picture in the background is one of the pictures I took myself for a project I worked on last year combining contemporary flavors with contemporary images.<br>
