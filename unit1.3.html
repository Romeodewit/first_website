            <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
            <p>
                Haven’t really found any drawbacks in using the IT tools we had on hand. I might have added some extra tools to use for website layouts since coding a layout is quite complicated, with making sure everything is a certain number of pixels away from each other. I could have definitely been more efficient with my website building. I spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos on how to get a nice navigation bar going, and how to add effects which is time I should have spent on the actual layout of the website and making everything more readable. If I would be redoing the project I would probably keep it simpler to ensure the final version looks a lot easier to sophisticated and modern, without too many bells and whistles.

            <p>
                I feel like I’ve been very productive in this project. However, I should start taking actual breaks. This has been one of my downfalls in this project and because of it I sometimes wasn’t completely focused during some of the classes, because my brain would be quite tired and have difficulty taking in information. 
                Another way would be to definitely do a bit more research before starting to code up the website since I think I’ve probably changed the layout about 3 times which is not very efficient. With better visualization of what I wanted the end product to look like and better planning, the final project would have been more efficiently handled.

            <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
            <p>
                If I would have to do a project like this again, I would definitely have someone with me who’d be a lot more visually creative. I have no difficulty writing up long strings of code, I can get basic code to perform its function, and I seem to pick up the logic behind it quite quickly, however, I’m definitely not a “visual creative” and when it comes to making the actual website look pretty I get stuck pretty quickly and need a lot of inspiration from different websites to ensure I can creating something that’s not only functional but also pleasing to the eyes. If I would have a team member with me, I’d definitely use Trello a lot more to ensure tasks a divided properly as well as GitHub for easy and quick access to the actual files when working remotely.

            <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
            <p>
                When testing the project, I tested pretty much on the go. So I would add in a certain function, bit of text, or link, and test it right away to see If it worked. Sometimes when adding in a new bit of text or function it completely messes up the entire layout. This is why testing during coding is so important. If you can assess an issue early on when you put in a new bit of code, it’s easy to pinpoint where you went wrong, making it a lot easier to fix. Final testing on the website functionality is always best done in a group. Input from others is quite important when working on final testing to ensure everything works accordingly but also might help with any design or readability issues you might not necessarily pick up on yourself. Also, ensure all the links you put into the final website are tested and take you to the right page, these are pretty common mistakes to make, and very easy to fix.
